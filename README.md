I typed comments at each commit but going back now and revisiting those is not fresh in my mind. I found i can grasp the concept of this and how it works and where. I have a very basic 
understaning of binding methods to context outside of the current "Scope".
I have a basic understanding of how you can create a subclass using inheritence using the "extend" keyword  in this format  class NewClass extends OriginalClass {
I have a basic understanding afet some practice of creating classes that are essentialy prototypes or molds of objects i can then create using the "new" keyboard and then assinging
those preset properties to vlaues for the new object.
